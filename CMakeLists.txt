cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.8)
#
# The KenLM cmake files make use of add_library(... OBJECTS ...)
# 
# This syntax allows grouping of source files when compiling
# (effectively creating "fake" libraries based on source subdirs).
# 
# This syntax was only added in cmake version 2.8.8
#
# see http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Tutorials/Object_Library
